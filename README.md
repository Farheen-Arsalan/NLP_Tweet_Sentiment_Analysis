# Tweet Sentiment Analysis using RNN and LSTM

Sentiment analysis refers to the idea of predicting the sentiment ( happy, sad, neutral) from a particular text. In this blog, I will be performing sentiment analysis on a large real-world dataset by applying techniques of NLP(Natural Language Processing).

I am taking my data from the “Sentiment140” dataset available in Kaggle. It has around 1.6 million tweets that have been extracted. You can access the dataset here: dataset. The annotations or labels for the tweets are as follows:

0 = negative

4 = positive
